What a miracle your life really is when you stop to think about it. Every second of every day, billions of creatures are formed from the substance that creates them. What were the chances that you ended up as a human? An organism that is not only able to think, but to understand where it is in the universe?

Additionally, what are the chances that you ended up in a relatively good position compared to other humans? I make this assumption as someone who is connected to the Internet, and who has the ability to spend time on my website.

Yet when we are consumed by the worries of our day, and the anxiety of watching the news, it is easy to forget how lucky we really are. You are one in a billion, of every second of every day.
