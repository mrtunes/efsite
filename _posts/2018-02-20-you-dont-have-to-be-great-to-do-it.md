Watching the Olympics with mom, she reminisces about how she used to figure skate. I asked her if she was any good, and she said honestly, &#8220;no&#8221;. It was what she followed up with which made for the sage advice though. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be good at something to do it&#8221;.

I think this is really good for adults in particular to keep in mind. A lot of people don&#8217;t bother to pick up a musical instrument, fearing what the process will do to their ego. I don&#8217;t love [making YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVty1QwIaA60agM_FpV7aug) at the moment, as I know that the quality is a lot lower than that of the big names on the platform.

If you can&#8217;t get out of your own way though, you won&#8217;t learn any new skills, and ultimately won&#8217;t be able to grow.
