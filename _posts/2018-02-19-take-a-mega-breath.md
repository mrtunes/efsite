Sometimes just three deep breaths is all you need to reset yourself. I also like to take one mega breath.

The way it works is as follows: You breath in, and try to think of anything that is worrying you at the moment, all the stressors of life&#8230; and then get rid of everything on the big exhale.

Try it, and your state should improve a little.
