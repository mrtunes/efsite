Consider taking an alternate route to work. One that might add an insane amount of time to your travels. It will help shake up your routine a bit.

This morning I took an alternate route. It involved getting on a different bus. Combined with the fact that the bus was already going out of my way, the driver told me we would be wasting about ten minutes on a side street. Perfect!

I was a little surprised that we literally sat idle on a side street for ten minutes, but I took the time to revel in this choice.

Now dear reader, it goes without saying that you can only take an alternate route if you leave time for it. Get your ducks in a row so that you have extra time for playing around and taking alternate routes.
