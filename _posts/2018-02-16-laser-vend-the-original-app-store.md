<span style="font-size: 1rem;">In the 1990s, one of the best uses for the computer was to play games, and specifically there was a whole world of &#8220;shareware&#8221;. They were basically demo versions of a larger game, and usually it was fairly simple in scope. An example of one such game would be Doom, the original first-person-shooter. You might get the first few levels of the game in its shareware form. </span>

At the local video store, there used to be a &#8220;Shareware vending machine&#8221;. You would bring a blank disk, and after making your purchase it would copy the program to your disk for you to take home and run on the computer.

I found [one article referencing this machine](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/500823/SOFTWARE-OFFERED-VIA-VENDING-MACHINE.html), and it was apparently called the Laser Vend.  Obviously the need for this type of distribution model was obsolete very quick after you could download the games on the Internet within a few years.
