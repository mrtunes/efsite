  Discovering an underpass on a damp, cold night. The Wedding neighbourhood is unfamiliar, and i've just come from a mausoleum turned art gallery.
  
  Ghosts of hedonists long gone linger in the air.
  
  The city flies under the radar of the rest of the country, and lives by its own rules.
  
  For this moment, I am flying beneath the surface of all that is real, in the city called Berlin.

Discovering an underpass on a damp, cold night. The Wedding neighbourhood is unfamiliar, and i&#8217;ve just come from a mausoleum turned art gallery. 

Ghosts of hedonists long gone linger in the air. 

The city flies under the radar of the rest of the country, and lives by its own rules. 

For this moment, I am flying beneath the surface of all that is real, in the city called Berlin.
