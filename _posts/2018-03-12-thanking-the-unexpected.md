One way of thinking about gratitude is to thank all the obvious forces and people in your life. But that doesn&#8217;t really offer any real shift in thinking.

Try to be thankful for the little things that edge into the space of ridiculous. For example, can you be grateful to YouTube, for [hosting your videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVty1QwIaA60agM_FpV7aug) so that you don&#8217;t have to worry about server space? Or how about being grateful to even the web host that you _pay_ for hosting (thank you [A Small Orange](https://asmallorange.com/))? Sure, you pay for it, but don&#8217;t they do such a great job at keeping your website running?

These are two fairly technical examples, but the point of the exercise is this: Instead of going about your day feeling like everyone owes you for all the hard work you&#8217;ve been doing, it must feel a lot more refreshing to go about your day as if everyone is doing _you_ the favour. They are lending their energy to your mission, and all these people and things are acting in support of you.
