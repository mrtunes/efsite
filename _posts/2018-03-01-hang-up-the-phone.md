I&#8217;ve been watching the Grateful Dead documentary, Long Strange Trip, and I heard a quote from Alan Watts on the psychedelic experience: &#8220;When you get the message, hang up the phone&#8221;.

It makes me think about how many times we check our email throughout the day, for little to no benefit. So next time you get the message, hang up the phone afterwards by logging out of your account.
