The last time you went skiing as a child?

This might seem rather trivial at first thought but then you consider it a little further: What was the last day you went skiing like? When you left the slopes that day did you agree with your family that you would not return the next season? Was it a good day of skiing or was the weather not in your favour?

For me this is frustrating because whatever this last day was like, I did not ski again for at least 20 years. I also don&#8217;t know how the skiing tradition ended. Was it an abrupt ending, in which we didn&#8217;t bother to get our skis fitted the following year, or did everything slowly peter out over time as we entered high school?

Either way, can you remember?
