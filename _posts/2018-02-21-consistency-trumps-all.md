I am on a new burst of projects, which is probably a result of regrouping after the new year&#8217;s season. One of them is writing on this blog, and the other is making YouTube videos for the Spaghetti Lab channel. Something that I haven&#8217;t really embraced in the past, which i&#8217;m really working on this time around, is working on my ability to be **consistent** more than my ability to _sprint_.

Sprinting through a creative project is great, but it doesn&#8217;t always ensure that you will have the steam to keep going when you hit one of the numerous roadblocks that are inevitable. Running a marathon, on the other hand, should be the move to focus on. You can address the resistance on a gradual level, and hopefully not bite off more than you can chew.
