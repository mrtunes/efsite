We are born with our eyes at the front of our head, and our ears to the side. That means everything we know about the world is defined by this bias.

What would the world look like if our eyes were located where our ears are? For starters we wouldn&#8217;t enjoy trying to walk in a straight line ahead of us. And all the rules of the world would be completely rewritten.
