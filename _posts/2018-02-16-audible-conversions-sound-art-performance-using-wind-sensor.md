_Performed at NAISA&#8217;s TransX Symposium in 2015._ 

This performance uses an anemometer used for measuring wind speed (running on Raspberry Pi), which then in turn changes the station on a radio (a simple arduino motor). The sounds are further processed by the performer.

Performance by Elliott Fienberg
  
Anemometer provided by [The Patching Zone](https://www.patchingzone.net/) in Rotterdam
  
Videography by Stefan Rose
  
Sound Spatialization by Darren Copeland and Matt Miller

Venue: Theatre Direct inside the Wychwood Barns (Toronto, Canada)
  
Commissioned by: [New Adventures in Sound Art](http://naisa.ca/) (NAISA)
