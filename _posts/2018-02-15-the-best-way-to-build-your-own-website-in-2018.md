For many years I didn&#8217;t touch websites with a ten foot pole. I find them frustrating to build and manage, and my job at the time didn&#8217;t require that I build sites from scratch. So I picked up some more useful skills instead, like learning about email marketing, and more recently I have been learning about paid advertising with facebook ads and google adwords.

However, after starting a project like [Spaghetti Lab](http://spaghettilab.ca), and wanting to get some of my projects on this very site in the form of a portfolio, I had to dip my toes back into the water. I learned some tough lessons along the way, and i&#8217;m happy to share them with you.

### 1: WordPress is still the Industry Standard

As frustrating as it is sometimes, I haven&#8217;t really seen anything to upend [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) yet for building content driven websites. You can go with commercial apps like [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com), [Wix](http://wix.com) and [Weebly](http://weebly.com) to get something up quick, but for more robust features you will usually end up on WordPress. Even if you start a shop on [Shopify](http://shopify.com), it can be frustrating to build out content on that platform at times.

### 2: Generalist Themes are a Tough Go

There are a lot of themes that can promise you &#8220;100 sites in 1&#8221;. I tried one called the [X Theme](https://theme.co/x/), which although looked great on the surface, ended up having a steep learning curve. Ultimately I got frustrated and had to stop using it. I have learned that it&#8217;s better to research a theme company, and sign up for a package with them. I am currently learning how to use [Elma Studio&#8217;s themes](https://www.elmastudio.de/en/), which are good for minimalist sites, but I also found [Array Themes](https://arraythemes.com/wordpress-themes/) (Professional), and [Themebeans](https://themebeans.com/themes/) (Creative). There was one **free WordPress theme** that I found to be really good, which is [iA4](http://alice.ia.net/).

### 3: Flat File CMS Are the Rage

If you are the hands-on type, and you find the admin panels of a system like WordPress frustrating, not to mention keeping the system updated and fast, then you might want to take a look at a **Flat File CMS** and also known as **Headless CMS**. This means that all your pages and blog posts sit in files on your computer, and the whole website gets uploaded in one-go using a tool like GitHub. Or the files can be uploaded to your site using FTP and then the new pages will appear.

The benefit to all this is that the site will run really fast, and you won&#8217;t be spending your day poking around menus. The downside is it&#8217;s for the more technically inclined web publisher. Take a look at [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) if your curiosity has been piqued.

To sum up: It takes a lot of research to find the right system to power your website. Hopefully you have a few new good options here.
