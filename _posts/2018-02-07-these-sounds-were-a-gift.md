As I walked by a tree on my way to work this morning, I heard a creaking sound. I looked up, concerned that the tree was making these sounds because it was about to fall on my head. The reason couldn&#8217;t be farther from this guess: A little woodpecker was going to work on the bark. I stood there for a good minute, just taking in the sights and sounds of this amazing bird smashing its head against the tree.

Later on, in the quiet of the night, I went outside to take out the trash. Another curious sound greeted me. This time it was the hoots of an owl. I looked in the direction of it, hoping to see it revealed, but no such luck.

These sounds were a gift.
