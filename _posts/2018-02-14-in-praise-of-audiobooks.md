I spent many years shunning the practise of listening to books on tape. I associated them with people who are too lazy to read. Lately I changed my tune on this issue. They are a great way to take in a book while on-the-go. Plus I can always go back and re-read the book in text form later on if I so desire.

As a member of the Toronto Public Library, one gets access to the [Overdrive service](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?R=EDB0095). I imagine many other local libraries get access to a similar service. If you are willing to shell out money, you can always sign up for [Audible](https://www.audible.ca/). So far I have listened to:

  * Change Your Brain, Change Your Body by Daniel Amen
  * 10% Happier: Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics by Dan Harris
  * You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness by Jenn Sincero
  * The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace Wattles

At the time of this post I am currently listening to Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers.

If you haven&#8217;t tried audiobooks yet, I recommend you give them a shot. They just might save your life.
