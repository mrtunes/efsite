This morning I went to LifeLabs. They wanted to take my lipids, so I told them they can have them.

The woman behind the desk calls out the name &#8220;Harvey Finkleberg&#8221;, so I go into the cubicle and start to ruminate about how awful her pronunciation of Jewish names is, or that maybe she just can&#8217;t read, which makes me more afraid that she&#8217;s handling important files.

She comes to meet me in the cubicle and wants to confirm that I&#8217;m Harvey Finkleberg, and I say yes I&#8217;m Elliott Fi<span class="text_exposed_show">enberg, and then she shakes her head and yells back to the waiting room. “Harvey Finkleberg, I called your name and someone else went in instead of you!”.</span>

    As the older man gets up, shaken, I am laughing hysterically. “Stop laughing, this isn’t funny”, she snaps at me. I sit back in the chair and try to keep it to myself.

    But then I realize that this <strong>is</strong> no joke, for in the span of forty years I in turn might become Harvey Finkleberg, moping around a lab, waiting for them to take my lipids. And then it dawns on me: To prevent this from happening, we need to go back in time and convince my mom to marry a Spaniard instead.
