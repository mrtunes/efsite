You have a problem, so you buy a product to fix that problem.

This is the case for me, and my inability to wake up in the morning.

I am tempted to buy a &#8216;sunrise alarm clock&#8217;, which will slowly beam a ton of light into the bedroom for me. Sure it would help, but it doesn&#8217;t address the issue that I can&#8217;t pull myself out of bed, and turn the lights on myself.

Buying motivation is convenient, but strengthening your willpower by creating good habits is a whole lot more effective.
